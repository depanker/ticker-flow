[[how_to_run]]
= How to run the software
To run the software, use the terminal, `cd` to `ticker-flow`
type `./mvnw clean  install`. After the process gets successfully competed
a jar `ticker-flow-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` will get created under target/ directory
Now there are two ways to run the jar

====== 1. Execute `java -jar target/ticker-flow-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`. Once the jar is up, below mentioned curl request's could be used as test cases.
====== 2. Alternatively if docker is installed on the system following command can start the application as Docker container
2.1 Build the docker image `docker build -t depanker/ticker-flow .` or pull the image from dockerhub using `docker pull depanker/ticker-flow`

2.2 Once the above command has been successfully installed, execute the following `docker run -p 8080:8080 -t depanker/ticker-flow`
