=== About API
###  This API expects a SQL query to lookup the data form exported csv. As mentioned in the requirements NO DATABASE is being used.
SQL syntax supports selecting all columns using

`SELECT *` or specific columns which can have following values `TIMESTAMP,PRICE,CLOSE_PRICE,CURRENCY,RIC`.

`FROM` needs to  be value or RIC in exported CSV example "AAPL.OQ".

`WHERE` clause only support's AND operator for now.

`ORDER BY` clause  is supported with multiple columns.


A Sample query could be

`select PRICE,  CLOSE_PRICE from AAPL.OQ where   PRICE > 4 order by timestamp asc, price desc`

For columns containing numerical values following operators are valid.
`'=', '<', '<=', '>', '>=', '!='`

For columns containing string values following operators are valid
`'=', '!='`
